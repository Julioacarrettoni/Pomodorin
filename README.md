# Introduction

On the daily use of the *Pomodoro Technique (R)*, I prefer to use a pencil and a diary for the task tracking. Handwriting all of that allows me to be more concious of the pending things to do.

Most of the better software tools for this technique available, includes functionality that makes the UI more complex or distractive, like TO-DO lists, tasks categories and lots of options I do not want to be present there. Or, in the other extreme, are just too simple.

So, when looking for a simple timer for this technique, including some features that are boring to do with a pencil, like record diary statistics of finished pomodoris and interruptions and not much more.

As couldn't find anything free, implemented this one.


# Usage

The UI target is to be simple and clear. If you allways click at the big image at the center, it will do what you need most of the time.


## How to start a new pomodori?
You can click on the big tomato button:

  ![Main view](readmeAssets/mainScreen.png)

If you just finished a break, the following window will be shown:

![Deciding next step](readmeAssets/decideWhatIsNext_tomato.png)

That could be different, depending on your current session, because Pomodorin will recommend you the next step, making that button bigger than the alternatives. So, if you just finished a pomodori, that window will look like:

![Deciding next step](readmeAssets/decideWhatIsNext_shortBreak.png)

It doesn't matter if small or big, the tomato button start a pomodori.


## How to start a break?
Just by clicking on the hourglass buttons.

Short break:

## How to stop a pomodori or break?
The small "-" button at the bottom of the screen is what you want.
